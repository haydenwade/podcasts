This podcast will cover the tactical steps needed to land your dream job. I&apos;ll be covering everything needed to get you your first software engineering job or internship, such as interviewing tips and tricks, resume advice, studying for technical interviews, and negotiating offers. <br/><br/>For those who have already landed their first software engineering job, I&apos;ll be covering how to grow and advance in your career, how to become a leader on your team and within an organization, and how to navigate the journey of a software engineer. <br/><br/>You will hear from special guests from a variety of roles to give you better insight and a different perspective into what it&apos;s like to be a software engineer. A few examples include: having a hiring manager on to talk about what she or he looks for in an ideal candidate, having a recruiter on to talk about how they can serve you best as a software engineer searching for a new job, or having a software engineer on to talk about their experience as a software engineer.<br/><br/><br/>Social Media:<br/><a href='https://www.zeroplusonepodcast.com'>zeroplusonepodcast.com<br/></a><a href='https://www.instagram.com/zeroplusonepodcast'>instagram.com/zeroplusonepodcast<br/></a><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/zeroplusonepodcast'>linkedin.com/company/zeroplusonepodcast<br/></a><a href='https://www.twitter.com/zeroplusonepod'>twitter.com/zeroplusonepod<br/></a><a href='https://www.facebook.com/zeroplusonepodcast'>facebook.com/zeroplusonepodcast</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
