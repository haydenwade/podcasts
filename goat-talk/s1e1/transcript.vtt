00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.102
Hi, guys.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:14.025
Welcome to Goat Talk, the number one growth podcast on the Internet.

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:16.109
I'm your host, Hayden Wade.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.097
And I am Cody Winter and Justin Mueller.

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:23.885
All right, let's go.

00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:26.678
Radio Voice there it I try, man.

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:31.829
It's not there just yet, but I'm working on it, that's for sure.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.677
But I'm excited to be here, that's for sure.

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:37.509
This is going to be an awesome podcast that we got going.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.881
And man, I'm fired up.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:41.033
I'm fired up.

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.985
Yeah, maybe let's kick off.

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:50.219
What the heck is goat talk? Who we are? Just answer those two questions and go from there.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.054
Cody, you want to go? Yeah.

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.002
So. My name is Cody Winter.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.719
I'm super excited to be here.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.954
Who am I and what is growth? Goats.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.417
What's? The Growth Goats podcast.

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.329
What's? The goat talk podcast.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.245
So. My name is Cody Winter.

00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:10.174
I'm from Wisconsin, born and raised.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:17.346
I'm a Midwest guy, right? So I've been grown up in a Midwest family, and I've been an entrepreneur at my heart my whole life.

00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:19.085
Ever since I was ten years old.

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:24.225
I was working in the restaurant industry with my stepdad, and he owned and operated multiple restaurants.

00:01:24.257 --> 00:01:29.573
And as soon as I got out of high school, I decided to not go the college route. I knew that wasn't for me.

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:40.554
I started out working in the restaurant industry, and then about a year into doing that, I actually opened up my very first business with my best friend, Justin Mueller, which was awesome.

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:41.962
So we started a business together.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:46.638
We were in business for three years together doing that, and that was an awesome experience.

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:47.742
We learned a lot together.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:49.373
We traveled all around together.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:57.694
And then we decided in the last six months that we wanted to put the financial service policy, the financial service company, on autopilot.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.626
So we did that.

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:05.793
And now we are excited with our new adventure, which is a real estate company that we are starting, our real estate investment company.

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:12.834
And we are teaching people all around the country the ins and outs when it comes to cash, investing, and wholesaling and real estate.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.366
And we're super excited about where that's going.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:21.366
And the name of our new company is Winwin Properties, a three way foundation between Justin, my brother, and I.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:23.162
And I'm super excited to be here.

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:38.382
Super excited to be a part of Growth Goats and excited to see this community blow up and change the whole face of when it comes to personal development, community growing with other people becoming the better you, becoming the greatest of all time.

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:39.002
The goats.

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.093
I'm excited for that.

00:02:40.132 --> 00:02:42.110
So that's a little bit about me.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.669
Why don't I pass it over to one of the other goats so they can tell you a little bit about themselves? Hayden.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.545
Hayden Wade, tell us about yourself.

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:50.557
What's up, guys? I'm Hayden wade.

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:54.610
I'm a founder, investor, career coach, adventure seeker.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.062
My background is in tech.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:02:59.538
Went to school for software engineering.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:08.566
Now. I enjoy building products, teams, dabbling side projects, and climbing mountains. That's a little bit about me.

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:15.289
And I'm excited to share with you Growth Gouts and everything we're going to bring to this community and this podcast.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.060
So I'll kick it over to Justin real quick.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.737
Yeah, I'm Justin.

00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:22.557
I'm 25 years old.

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:23.993
I live in the Midwest.

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:33.789
I was born and raised just like Cody, small towns, lots of farms, lots of corn, and lots of cows and beer and cheese.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.021
But yeah, wisconsin.

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:40.530
I was born in Wisconsin right out of high school, actually.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.645
In high school, I had started a couple of businesses.

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:46.580
Like, I was an entrepreneur early on.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.966
My family has actually started multiple really successful businesses, and it always inspired me.

00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:55.270
And that's kind of what's taken me on this journey.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.846
And that's kind of what makes me so excited about Growth Goats, is that these talks, this podcast.

00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:05.018
Oh, man, dude, I'm super fired up for it.

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:17.230
I think a lot of people here knew from a young age that they wanted to be something. They wanted to go somewhere, they wanted to be around good people. That's what I thought, at least.

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:27.601
And in Growth Goats, this community is going to, I think, bring it to the next level for anyone who's here, really.

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:34.050
I mean, I've already started to see a lot of improvement in a lot of the community, and it's super cool to see.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.180
And, yeah, that's a little bit about me.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.086
And, yeah, I'm fired up, yes.

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:40.470
To bring it closer.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.449
Justin, Cody and I all met in Minneapolis.

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.322
I'm originally from Green Bay, Wisconsin.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:52.779
So if you think you have a cheese curd that's better than Wisconsin cheese curd, we'll challenge you.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.874
We can argue about what the best Wisconsin cheese curd is, because there is even a tier list for that.

00:04:59.072 --> 00:05:02.250
Yeah, there's definitely a tier list for that.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.322
Yeah. So it's super awesome.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:10.509
We all met together in Minneapolis, and we met about, I want to say almost a year and a half ago, two years ago.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.033
And it was right after the pandemic had started, right when things kind of started opening back up.

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:21.954
And we all met and we all were running individual businesses at the time.

00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:38.262
And then about six months or not even six months ago, about, say about 70 days ago, 60 days ago, we all got together and reconnected, and then we had an idea to start this awesome community because we were all talking and we were like, man, I wish we were all part of something.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:59.293
And then we all kind of decided, why don't we just take the bull by the horns and start something of ourselves? And if you can't find a good community of like minded people, you might as well start your own, right? So that's what we're here to do, is help people that were in that situation all over the country, which is super cool, and we're not trying to sell you anything. Yeah, exactly.

00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:00.430
I think that's huge.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:01.742
I think that's huge.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:03.233
Yeah. It's all free.

00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.338
We're here to help.

00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:05.889
We want you to succeed.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.766
Yes, we've mentioned growth goats.

00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:14.113
But what is growth goats? Yeah.

00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:16.021
You want to answer them? Yeah.

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:30.362
So Growth Goats is a community that we started that is all about bringing people together to have a common goal of getting better at whatever it is you want in your life.

00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:34.490
How to be a better person, a better husband, a better business owner.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:43.017
Just to be the goat, the greatest of all time when it comes to growing together. Right? So that's what growth goats is.

00:06:43.024 --> 00:06:51.278
It's a community of like minded individuals, a group of people that want to grow, that want to see each other win, that want to learn from each other.

00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:56.733
Right. We want to have a community of people in every industry and every type of lifestyle.

00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:11.829
People who have been married for 20 years, people who have kids, people who are very successful at their job, people who are in all different types of industries where we can come together and we can learn and grow as a community and just make all of our lives better.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:25.146
Right? Who doesn't want to do that? Who doesn't want to level up? Who doesn't want to take everything to the next level, right? So that's what we're focused on, is how can we help as many people reach their max potential? Because we all have kind of what Justin was talking about.

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:28.201
We all have that feeling inside of us where we want to be something.

00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:30.694
We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.

00:07:30.822 --> 00:07:34.377
And that's why this community is so important, because that's what we're going to be doing.

00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:37.146
We know that we want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.494
We want to help people.

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:54.898
And that's why we're doing this, because there's a big especially now, right? I mean, it feels like right now more than ever, America, the world is divided than ever, right? Politics, social status, social media.

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:56.254
Everybody is just so divided.

00:07:56.302 --> 00:07:57.954
Everyone has an opinion on everything.

00:07:58.072 --> 00:08:03.942
And what we want to do is we want to highlight some of the problems and not only highlight the problems, but bring a solution to those problems.

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:13.665
Right. How can we help people with mental health? How can we help people with personal development, being a better person, being a better wife, husband, son, father, whatever it is.

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:25.600
Right, so I think that sums up I went a little long there, but that sums up to me what it means to be a goat, right? What it means to be a Growth Goat community member, like what it means to be a g, right? AGG.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.742
Yeah, it's true.

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.398
Yeah, I think that was good.

00:08:30.483 --> 00:08:39.173
And I think that kind of hits on, like, that's a really good idea of I think it summed up there pretty well what growth Goats is Justin.

00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:41.009
Maybe one of you guys can have this.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:55.000
What can you expect if you're a Growth Goats member? If I'm somebody that's hearing our voice for the first time, they're like, what's this? What can they expect from it? I'll answer that if you're cool with that.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:02.953
Honestly, what can you expect is let me kind of back it up.

00:09:03.072 --> 00:09:16.799
Not like, go around the question, but kind of back that up with what makes us unique and would make you even want to join our group and a group of like minded people and maybe qualify to join the group.

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:18.717
We have, like, standards here.

00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:23.745
We've set really high standards of the quality of people that we want in this group.

00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:27.201
And I think just that alone is huge.

00:09:27.255 --> 00:09:48.645
Because if you're in the personal development space and you've joined facebook groups or maybe groups on LinkedIn I haven't really been on LinkedIn groups, but facebook groups specifically, I know are very watered down, and they'll just kind of accept anybody, and they're not really gearing it towards their audience to try and help them.

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:51.302
They're really just trying to grow a community, which is totally okay.

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:52.474
I mean, that's what they're trying to do.

00:09:52.511 --> 00:09:53.846
But that's kind of what makes us unique.

00:09:53.878 --> 00:09:56.139
And, I mean, we have a screening process.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.629
It's not watered down like other groups.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:04.399
You're going to have real people that can bring real value to you.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.645
And I don't know anything really more valuable than that, than having like minded people that just want to help.

00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:19.490
If you have a community like that, I don't see how you could not succeed unless you're not asking questions or reaching out.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:27.539
And I think that what you can really expect is, like, high standards people who are motivated every day.

00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:41.820
There's days where I'm down, and then I'll open the Growth Goats chat, like the exclusive chat on Facebook, and it's just like, dude, people like, posting wins of the day or posting something that went wrong and how they made it right.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.899
It's just really cool.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.553
Yeah. No, I like that.

00:10:46.672 --> 00:10:47.754
That's awesome, man.

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:52.265
It basically explains exactly who we want, what you can expect from it.

00:10:52.288 --> 00:11:12.990
And we're not looking to work with everyone, but if you're looking for something where you can be held accountable, you can grow, you can learn from other people and be in an environment that's judge free and very friendly, very awesome place with people coming together who think like that. If that's you any of those things I just mentioned, congratulations.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.014
You're hearing my voice.

00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:15.153
You're in the right place.

00:11:15.272 --> 00:11:18.769
Right? So that's what we wanted to talk to a little bit about today.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.405
What we wanted to talk about, we talked a little bit about who we are now.

00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:24.120
You know who we are a little bit.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:41.317
We wanted to talk about a little bit today with our first episode, the Kick Off. Right? We want to be able to look back at this when we have 100,000 members nationwide and we're doing live events and filling up arenas and football stadiums of all of our goats.

00:11:41.494 --> 00:12:09.714
But we want to talk about a little bit about what are the challenges with building a community like this? What discipline does it take? What are some of the challenges, what are some of the adversities you go through? Because anybody out there that's looking even to build maybe not a community, but maybe you're trying to build a recreation football team, or maybe you're trying to build maybe you're trying to build a community church project or whatever you're trying to do.

00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:18.053
Whenever you're trying to get a group of people together to go down the same vision that are all shooting for the same thing, you're going to have some challenges, right? Obviously.

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:21.046
So there's some challenges that we've have faced, and we'd love to talk about it.

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:34.861
So that way, if you're going to go out and build a community, maybe what we talk about can help you either go through that or understand what's going on, understand it's a part of the process, or completely avoid some of the headaches that we've had to go through and can help you do that.

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:50.337
Right. So I'd like to kind of just kick it off with that, right? Kind of just open discussion, whoever wants to go for but I know we've all had some challenges. I know Hayden and Justin, they make it look easy, right? But it's definitely been hard.

00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:53.922
Right? There's been some challenges, and that's anything in life.

00:12:53.975 --> 00:13:06.450
But what would you guys say are some of the challenges that we've gone through starting this group? Yeah, I would say just like what we'll talk about the rest of the episode here is not just for building communities.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:20.070
It's for building a brand, whether it's your personal brand, your company, help sell yourself to get the next job or the promotion, whatever it might be. Yeah.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:31.038
So to go back on the great vision of growth goats, what that looks like in person events all over the world would be amazing.

00:13:31.203 --> 00:13:33.039
Selling out arena is great.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:46.870
But yeah, right now, what's that look like? For us, it's a private Facebook group, an Instagram, where we're doing random live streams with just the founders, covering topics, engaging with audience.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:14:07.769
And then we just announced last week that we're doing a private, weekly live call with all community members where we'll really engage with each member, help them overcome challenges that they're facing in their lives, provide them value, get them to the next level, share wins, share those struggles.

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:16.394
Then to circle back to Cody's question, like, what's been the biggest challenge? Making sure we have quality individuals.

00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:21.149
I think having a diverse group of people is a real big challenge.

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:37.779
We want people with a diverse group of backgrounds, gender, race, age, you name it, because everybody has different experiences, and those are super valuable perspectives to have when it comes to solving problems.

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:42.870
Not to interrupt you, Hayden, but I just wanted to hit on this, so I don't want to lose my thought.

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:45.669
I like what you said, like, finding quality people.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:54.953
What are some of the ways we're doing that? Is it's easy to say, but how are we finding quality people? Like, what's a good way to do that? Yeah.

00:14:54.991 --> 00:15:02.538
I'd say engage in conversation, fill out whether or not the individual is truly looking to grow.

00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:03.833
That's like our use case.

00:15:03.871 --> 00:15:05.758
We want a community of people who want to grow.

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:16.580
So talking with people, understanding if they want to grow, and if you get that feeling they do at the end of the conversation, extend them invite to the private Facebook group.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.220
That's kind of how I've been approaching it.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:24.337
Yeah, I like that because that's how you can find you're not trying to sell them on something.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.769
Right. That's how you find a good quality.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.193
And like you said, in anything, building a brand or anything like that, you don't want to feel like you're constantly selling.

00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:37.302
Right. Just kind of put it out there and let the chips fall where they're may kind of what you're saying.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:47.909
Yeah. And a second technique we've been using is in every one of our videos where we talk about how to join the group, we say DMs GG to get an invite.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:16:00.701
So by making people take that action, they already put theirselves above the other people who aren't willing to take action and make change in their lives. Some people aren't looking to make change, and that's okay.

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:04.461
Nothing against those people, but yeah.

00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:14.898
So those people who DM us, they get the invite, they get on board into the group through our screening process, and then they get all the info on the live calls and stuff like that as well.

00:16:15.063 --> 00:16:23.846
That's been going really well, too, because we've been getting multiple there's been times where we missed, like, somebody messaged us GG right as it was happening, and we totally missed it.

00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:25.413
We had to follow back with them.

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:31.285
But that's been doing really well with saying that every video being consistent with it.

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:36.758
Right. That's really important because if we miss a video, then it's like now we're not being consistent.

00:16:36.774 --> 00:16:39.274
And when the group is not going well, that could be that's part of it.

00:16:39.312 --> 00:16:41.594
Right. So being consistent, I think, is huge.

00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:46.850
What do you think, Justin? Sorry, I kind of blanked.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.570
What was the question? Were you talking about money? I was listening.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.741
No, you're good.

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:54.046
We were just talking about what are some of the challenges? Right.

00:16:54.067 --> 00:17:01.953
So Hayden was just talking about how engagement is really good, getting people engaged, and then also finding really good, diverse people.

00:17:01.991 --> 00:17:17.670
What would you say are like a challenge that some of the other challenges we've gone through? I think on a time perspective, I would say that was definitely a challenge.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.201
I know Hayden, he's over in Utah and he's super busy.

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:27.430
He's got his company, he's growing side projects.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.210
And then, you know, Cody and I were super busy.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:42.221
And obviously we still want to grow this group because we want to grow this thing to probably a million members, at least, like quality members.

00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:53.213
But I would say in my head, that's probably one of the biggest challenges because obviously, if you can put a lot more time towards something, it's just going to grow a lot faster.

00:17:53.261 --> 00:18:00.486
But that's the power of YouTube and that's the power of TikTok and Instagram, and that's why we're trying to utilize those things.

00:18:00.587 --> 00:18:07.077
And right now, though, I think we are doing pretty good just to start.

00:18:07.243 --> 00:18:20.940
And I think that's a concept that we've talked about before, Justin, you and I, individually, a lot, something that we have to talk about a lot, especially as young men who like to we're very active, we love to be outside, we love to be social.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:25.773
Kind of like that concept of temporary sacrifice for permanent gain, right?

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:35.539
What I mean by that is there's a lot of times at night where we start working on our community and obviously distractions come up.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:46.546
It's super nice out, or this person wants to do something or, hey, this event is going on, or, hey, this meeting is about to go on.

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:59.653
Right. So finding that time, I think that's really important because there's times where we don't want to, but at the end, it feels good once it's done, right? So I think that's a concept that's super powerful that we've talked about before.

00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:04.826
If you're not willing to sacrifice something, then there's not a whole lot of reward on that.

00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:14.301
At the end, you have to ask yourself, what am I willing to sacrifice now? So that way, when we do have those millions of hundreds of thousands, thousands of people, we're going to know why.

00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:21.034
Because we put in that work of sacrificing the golf games or the movie night with my wife.

00:19:21.082 --> 00:19:29.981
Right. It's awesome, too, that I have a partner that understands that that's huge. If you're out there and you have a partner, you definitely need to get on the same page with your partner about stuff like that.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:34.981
Because if you're not on the same page, it's going to be really hard for you to even have a happy relationship.

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:38.213
Ship so I love that, justin, that was really good, man.

00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:41.986
And I think that's a lot of the challenges that we've all been facing.

00:19:42.018 --> 00:19:46.945
And it's just like anything else, right? A lot of building a business, building a community, building your brand.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.940
You're going to run into a lot of the same problems.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.339
Yeah, I definitely get that.

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:59.259
Yeah, no, I think you're completely right.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:06.238
I think people can understand that as you get older and older, the more responsibilities you have, the harder things become.

00:20:06.324 --> 00:20:08.862
And that's just how life goes.

00:20:08.915 --> 00:20:09.965
And everyone understands that.

00:20:09.988 --> 00:20:20.099
I mean, there's some people out there, they have ten kids and they're still working and still doing what they need to do because they got the drive, they got the power of the will.

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:21.857
It's cool to see.

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:26.486
And I just want to take advantage of while we're young and I got the energy to do it.

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:27.829
I'm excited.

00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:33.400
There's a lot of value packed here and I can't wait for people to find it.

00:20:38.089 --> 00:20:47.301
One thing that's really interesting too, that I know we were going to talk about is kind of understanding what's our strategy for marketing.

00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:54.862
And I really want Hayden to hit on this because Hayden, he's really good at marketing, he's really good at social media.

00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:57.965
He's on top of the game, this guy for fun.

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:04.605
Sometimes he'll text me over these articles or he'll show me this stuff and he's like, it'll be like 1030 at night.

00:21:04.627 --> 00:21:08.365
And he's watching this video on how to get more engagement on Instagram.

00:21:08.397 --> 00:21:09.682
And he's like, oh, I love this stuff.

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.394
I'm like, man, that fires me up.

00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:31.993
So, hey, what would you say, for example, why are we doing it on Facebook versus anywhere else, right? Or versus this or that? Kind of go behind what was the thinking of that? Yeah, why we picked a private Facebook group over maybe Discord or a LinkedIn group.

00:21:32.112 --> 00:21:44.240
We just feel like the people who are targeting people in our age group, we're not discriminating on age, but we just generally think those are the people we can connect most with right now because they're at the similar stage in life.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.230
They probably have Facebook accounts.

00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:49.422
They know how to use a Facebook group.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.440
It's not super foreign to them.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.750
Whereas like Discord, it's very techy.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.220
A lot of gamers use it, things like that.

00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:06.213
There's been some crossover, but really use what's familiar, use what's easy to use.

00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:09.319
So for us, managing a community is hard.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.680
Facebook's got great community management tools that assist us.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.013
For example, it posts every week.

00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:28.198
What is your goal for the week? There's like posts throughout the month that it just automates that you can come up with so that super helps to just drive the conversation.

00:22:28.294 --> 00:22:37.470
And then as an admin, you can just hop in there, leave your $0.02, be more of a member versus an admin.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.786
Right. Because of these tools.

00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:46.690
So I think that's really valuable and I think ultimately, at the end of the day, listen to your community as you build it.

00:22:46.839 --> 00:23:04.710
So if you get down the road, you have 5100 members, 20 members, and you notice engagement is low, put out a survey, understand? Like, hey, is it because we're on Facebook? Or maybe you're getting a lot of DMs saying, hey, I would love to join your group, but I don't have Facebook.

00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:18.869
Maybe consider using a different platform or take a poll like, hey, which platform do you guys use most? It could be a WeChat group or Instagram, DMs.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.473
There's a bunch of different ways it could be.

00:23:20.511 --> 00:23:21.970
So just ask your audience.

00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:23.102
Ask your community.

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:49.233
They'll tell you, I love that, too, because then you get the community members more involved, right? If you're lacking engagement and then you're asking the community, and then you do what the community asks or the majority asks now they're like, okay, when I input my input, it doesn't fall on deaf ears, right? Like everybody has that feeling of when me and Justin Hayne and I know we've all been through it because we're entrepreneurs, but we've all had jobs before.

00:23:49.352 --> 00:23:58.273
And I'm sure there's people out there that's had a job where they come in and they see how things are running and they see things from, like, an employee perspective.

00:23:58.402 --> 00:24:09.241
And they try to go to the owner or the supervisor or whatever, and they try to tell them, hey, I'm noticing these things, and nine out of ten times, what is the answer? Oh, yeah, I've been here a while.

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:10.442
That's just how we do things.

00:24:10.496 --> 00:24:13.385
Or, oh, yeah, I'll bring it up to the boss, right? And it never gets there.

00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:16.574
Right? Why? Because you're, like, on the bottom of the food chain, right?

00:24:16.692 --> 00:24:22.170
How we envision growth coats going is once you pass the screening process, there is no food chain.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:28.993
Right? If you're making a million dollars a year or making $2,000 a month, it doesn't matter to us.

00:24:29.112 --> 00:24:30.046
You have an input.

00:24:30.077 --> 00:24:43.846
You have a say in what we want to dictate as a group, which is super cool, where you're at a job, and they just like, you see things being run, and you're like, oh, my gosh, we can grow this company together, but they just don't listen.

00:24:44.028 --> 00:24:45.569
Falls on deaf ears.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:57.769
Yeah. And sometimes the employee might be coming from a good place, but sometimes the business owner has gone through that for 1020 years and knows the ins and outs.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:08.894
But, yeah, dude, that's, like, super valuable just because, man, lost my thought process again.

00:25:08.932 --> 00:25:11.294
But basically, man, I don't know.

00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:33.269
With being an employee, when you come in to growth goats, I think that it's super powerful, especially with polls, just because when you have the standards that we have and the value that we bring and that our people bring the polls, I mean, dude, you get really good polls.

00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:40.602
You'll know what you need to do because of just of who the people that we have in our thing is.

00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:42.410
But yeah, no, really good.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.420
Really good.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.498
On the point.

00:25:45.584 --> 00:25:50.054
Just like, where are the people hanging out that you want to attract?

00:25:50.182 --> 00:26:02.201
Whether you're selling a product or a service or growing a community, where are those people hanging out, whether that's online, are they hanging out on Instagram? Are they hanging out on? TikTok LinkedIn.

00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:07.650
Where are they at? Right? So think about that and go from there.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:08.834
And then I don't know.

00:26:08.872 --> 00:26:14.740
Do we want to go into content strategy or anything like that? I think we could save that one for.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.006
Yeah, we could talk about that on a different day.

00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:21.382
I'd say good thing that to kind of touch a little bit on the content.

00:26:21.516 --> 00:26:29.730
One thing that we do is we have our Facebook group, but we also don't ignore the other platforms.

00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:34.614
They're just more of a tool that we use to lead people to the Facebook.

00:26:34.662 --> 00:26:45.930
Right. So we have an Instagram, we have a LinkedIn, we have a TikTok, we have in person clubhouses that we're working on, which is super awesome in in person locations.

00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:48.637
But it all leads back to like the Facebook group.

00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:50.301
Right. So that's super important.

00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:51.917
It's good to spread yourself out.

00:26:52.003 --> 00:26:54.029
Just don't spread yourself too thin.

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:57.266
Have a place that you can always kind of like call your home base.

00:26:57.367 --> 00:27:02.594
Right. So we talk to people on Instagram, talk to people on LinkedIn, and then we always just send them back.

00:27:02.711 --> 00:27:06.420
Right. Which is really good.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.160
And part of that is just selfish too.

00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:10.721
We're busy.

00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:17.799
It takes a lot of time if we have to manage all these different platforms, is the three of us.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:19.758
It's time consuming.

00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:21.258
It's a lot of effort and energy.

00:27:21.344 --> 00:27:22.140
It is.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:30.490
So if we can just focus on providing a ton of value in one place, that makes it so much easier.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.685
It helps everybody out.

00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:34.079
Yeah, exactly.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.894
I agree.

00:27:37.092 --> 00:27:38.221
Yeah. And I think it's good.

00:27:38.276 --> 00:27:40.799
I think we could, like I said, touch on it a little bit.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.726
Kind of what Hayden said before.

00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:49.521
There's a reason why I always say we don't just do things because we like to do them.

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:51.394
We always have a thought behind something.

00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:53.693
Right? So we always are really meticulous.

00:27:53.741 --> 00:28:04.534
When we think about when we make a post, we always ask ourselves, why are we posting this? What is this going to do for the group? How are people going to react? What's going to happen after we do this? Right? So kind of like what Hayden said.

00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:18.309
The reason why we chose Facebook, it was all the things that Hayden had mentioned, being really awesome for communities and really easy, user friendly. But also we understood that most of our members and future members would have Facebook.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:26.814
So understanding, like Hayden said, understanding where your people are going to be and just being there is half the game.

00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:34.445
Right. If you're somebody that if you're single, where do you probably go?

00:28:34.548 --> 00:28:36.465
Where all the other single people are.

00:28:36.567 --> 00:28:55.701
Right? So if you're single, you don't go to the couple's dancing class down the road, right? Because if you go down there, it can be a bunch of couples, right. You go to the speed dating networking, or you go to the nice restaurant down the road and maybe there's a hangout there and you have a chance to meet a single person there.

00:28:55.756 --> 00:28:59.713
Right. So it's all about putting yourself in the right environment.

00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:00.925
That's half the battle.

00:29:01.057 --> 00:29:04.981
Getting in the right environment is half the battle, in my opinion.

00:29:05.046 --> 00:29:15.854
So one of the things that people ask is that I think is really important to understand, something you kind of talked on before, Hayden, but I think this would be a really good point for people to understand.

00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:20.478
So what would you do and this has happened before, so I kind of want you to talk about it.

00:29:20.483 --> 00:29:28.130
Hayden, what would you do if somebody messages you on Instagram and then they say, oh, I don't have a Facebook.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.594
They don't have a Facebook? Yeah.

00:29:32.632 --> 00:29:35.925
I'd say like, hey, engage with our content.

00:29:36.028 --> 00:29:47.650
So say if they're on Instagram, but they're not on Facebook, gauge in our content DM us, we'll let you know when we join Instagram.

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:57.673
Say, if we get five people who say, hey, they don't have Facebook, but they have Instagram, then it's probably worth generating a group chat or maybe just start one from the beginning and just keep adding people.

00:29:57.711 --> 00:29:58.794
So it's easy.

00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:00.859
Yeah, true.

00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:01.993
Yeah, it's good.

00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:03.273
Always have a solution, right.

00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:05.690
You don't want to tell them, all right, well, you don't have a Facebook.

00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:07.385
Well, hit the road, Jack.

00:30:07.417 --> 00:30:07.998
See you later.

00:30:08.084 --> 00:30:18.741
Right. You want to give them a solution every time, even if it's something that is something that's temporary and you improve it later, they're going to appreciate, like, you're trying to get them involved.

00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:30.200
Make it a little extra effort, right? Maybe just say, oh, okay, well, yeah, put them in a group chat and then you start feeding that group chat or put them in a group text or whatever it is, right? Yeah.

00:30:31.609 --> 00:30:39.094
Hayden to kind of wrap up our first episode, which, by the way, I can't wait, we're going to be very consistent.

00:30:39.142 --> 00:30:41.082
We know that consistency is key.

00:30:41.215 --> 00:31:17.826
So in a year from now, when we all look back at our very first episode and we're celebrating and we're looking back and having good laughs and seeing our growth, what would you say, Hayden, is your vision, your plan for what we want to do with this goat talk and what we want to do with GG, just in general? Yeah, I think immediate focus is continuing to grow the group with a diverse group of people who really want to grow and then start up our local meetups.

00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:21.880
Start one in Minneapolis, start one here in Salt Lake City.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:35.900
Yeah. So if you listen to this podcast, made it this far, and this sounds like something you want to join DMs GG, we'll send you the Facebook group.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.034
So they can join the Facebook group.

00:31:41.071 --> 00:31:53.809
They can message all of our it'll be in the description of these videos or these podcasts, not videos, but there will be an access somewhere for the link to our personal account.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:02.269
And then again, you can go on IG and you can follow us at Growth Goats Underscore. So it's growth goats underscore.

00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:06.865
And then in our Facebook group, we have a private group, so you'll have to look up.

00:32:06.968 --> 00:32:10.417
You just go into the search go on groups and you'll look up growth goats.

00:32:10.513 --> 00:32:12.226
You'll see our logo.

00:32:12.258 --> 00:32:15.122
It's black with a goat on it, right? It says growth goats.

00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:20.902
And then you'll just have to complete a screening process once you get there. Once you go through that and you're in, you're good.

00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:27.241
And you'll get a message from me, Justin and Hayden right away once you do join, welcoming you into the group.

00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:33.390
So we look forward to having all new members in there once we start getting this consistent.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.470
I agree.

00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:37.039
Can't wait to see you guys there.

00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:39.710
Yeah, no, I'm super excited.

00:32:40.049 --> 00:32:42.557
First podcast of many to come.

00:32:42.644 --> 00:32:50.721
And I know that Hayden, Justin and I are so excited about what this is going to be and what we're going to do and how we're going to grow this thing.

00:32:50.776 --> 00:33:12.309
Right. I have a vision of helping not only helping other people this may sound a little selfish, but I see myself with this community because of this community becoming a way better husband to my beautiful or a better husband to my beautiful fiance, being a better son to my mother, being a better person that can lead people.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:20.490
Because one thing is once you start something like this, something that this has really taught me is once you start a community like this, it's kind of like all the eyeballs are on you.

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:26.846
Right. I couldn't be running this community and then not growing at the same time because people could see that, right.

00:33:26.867 --> 00:33:27.933
People can see through it.

00:33:27.971 --> 00:33:33.390
So once this community started, it really put a lot of self accountability on myself.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.814
Like now it's time to step up.

00:33:34.852 --> 00:33:40.642
Now I really need to make sure that I am doing what's right for me, my family, my community, every single day.

00:33:40.695 --> 00:33:43.185
I can't have any off days, which is super important.

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:45.377
So I love that about this community.

00:33:45.463 --> 00:33:47.859
The self accountability is huge.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.281
Yeah. Super excited, man.

00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:57.670
Do you guys feel that same way you guys been feeling that way since we started this? So much love in the group.

00:33:57.819 --> 00:33:59.461
I wake up and I just smile.

00:33:59.526 --> 00:34:01.210
Like it warms my soul.

00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:10.250
There's other people in the group who have messaged us and told us like, thank you guys so much for starting this community.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.958
I have a great place to there's people who have met each other.

00:34:15.043 --> 00:34:20.074
We've already had members hopping on phone calls and they're not even telling us and they're like connecting.

00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:21.710
I'm like, oh, my gosh, this is perfect.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.360
This is exactly what we want.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.500
Hayden kind of wrap it up here.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.153
We told them how they can join the group when they get in the group.

00:34:33.192 --> 00:34:34.322
You kind of touched on it before.

00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:36.797
We're going to be having weekly live calls.

00:34:36.813 --> 00:34:41.030
So what can people expect from the weekly live calls and then we'll wrap it up here.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:58.217
Yeah. So every week we'll have either a topic or exercise, engage everybody, go through and solve challenges that people are having or just share on like educate people on new I don't know, if they don't know anything about tech, educate them on tech.

00:34:58.304 --> 00:34:59.690
They don't know anything about sales.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.760
Educate them on sales, real estate, whatever it might be.

00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:09.199
So that's just like a high level of what the weekly live calls are.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.389
But yeah, you definitely want to be there.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.400
